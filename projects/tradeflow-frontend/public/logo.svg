    This SVG creates a shape with transparent diagonal slashes, leaving behind
    white stripes with rounded corners.
    
    It works by using a mask:
    1. A mask is defined containing three black, rotated rectangles with rounded corners.
    2. A solid white square is drawn.
    3. The mask is applied to the white square. The black shapes in the mask "cut out"
       or erase parts of the white square, leaving the final shape.

    <!-- 
      The mask defines what will be visible and what will be transparent.
      - 'white' areas in the mask are opaque (visible).
      - 'black' areas in the mask are transparent (cut out).

        This group contains the shapes that will be cut out (made transparent).
        The entire group is rotated -45 degrees to make the slashes diagonal.

          Three rectangles that will become the transparent slashes.
          The 'rx="5"' attribute is what creates the rounded corners.
          Increasing 'rx' will make the corners more round.

    This is the final visible element.
    It's a simple white square, with our mask applied to it.
    The mask cuts away the areas defined by the black shapes, creating the transparent slashes.
